# Student Statistic Management Project

As a first step project you are going to develop **Student Statistic Management** system using **only** HTML/CSS/Javascript 
The application will have a main table, where the student’s names are listed with the grade points assigned to them for every lecture and the average of points. 

Application has information about **Statistics of Student’s Results** which is divided into 

- Total number of days 
- Missed Lessons 
  - It is the total number of missed lessons by all students
- Average grade 
- Total number of students 
    
**Main Table Section:** 

- The ability to add a new day
  - This days are counted and are matched our current timetable how techhub's course has, starting from 30 April 
- The ability to remove the last added day 
- Update table which also updates statistic information 
  - It would be better if the statistics are updated all the time and not only after clicking the button
- Grade Min: the minimum value is 0. Any input lower than 0 is taken as zero and zero also represents missed lesson. 
  - Each square including 0 should be color red. 
- Grade Max: maximum value is 5, any input higher than 5 is considered as 5.  
- The point squares are editable any time. 
  - The Edit operation starts the users clicks in the cell  and appears javascript Prompt window. 
- Each column except average column must have date title.  
    
**Note** - Application should have responsive web design, Also separate the logic (Javascript code) from the design and the HTML pages.
